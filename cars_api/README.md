# Cars API!

## Lab: Django REST Framework & Docker
Use Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

### What can it do?
You can create an account with authentification. As an admin user you can add cars. The cars information can be converted to JSON. There is a full CRUD implementation for the JSON information.
